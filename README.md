The project consists of an online auction web application for used cars called masiniFA. The app is a modern solution for fast and efficient transactions, helping sellers sell their car instantly to our company and receive  the money on the spot. Afterwards, the car, which is now our property, will be auctioned off online. The aim of this project is to provide a secure and easy-to-use platform that will facilitate the auction process and benefit both buyers and sellers.
