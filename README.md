The project consists of an online used car auction web application called masiniFA. The application is a modern solution for fast and efficient transactions, helping sellers to instantly sell their car to our company and receive the money on the spot. Afterwards, the car, which is now our property, will be auctioned online. . The implementation of online auctions has created an environment where buyers have access to detailed information about cars and can make a decision to bid for it, and if our company agrees with the price given, it will take possession of the car. The purpose of this project is to provide a safe and easy-to-use platform that facilitates the auction process and benefits both buyers and sellers.
